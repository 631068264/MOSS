Discrimination is illegal and goes against the principles of fairness, equality, and respect. Educational institutions have a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive learning environment that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Any form of discrimination is detrimental to the well-being of individuals and society as a whole, and can have legal and social consequences. Instead, educators should focus on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom, and work towards creating a more equitable and just society.<eom>\n"}},"category":"harmless_en"}
